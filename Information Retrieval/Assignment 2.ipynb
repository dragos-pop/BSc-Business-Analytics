The prevalence of allergies in IC is reported to be between 40 and 80% of patients. The background of the association is not known and does not seem to be the result of a generalized allergic constitution. Some report that treatment of allergy sometimes has a beneficial effect on bladder symptoms. An increased expression of certain growth factors (PD-ECGF, FGF, and VEGF) has been found in the bladder of IC patients. In addition, the expression of CD44 was significantly higher in ulcer type IC than in non-ulcer type. In general, these growth factors are soluble and diffusible under normal conditions but proteoglycans such as CD44 could bind to these growth factors. This may promote the accumulation of growth factors at the sites of inflammation. CD44 expression in ulcer type IC could explain the prolonged and stronger expression of GAG-binding growth factors that promote inflammation. In the Rotterdam study, a strong association between IC and Sjögren's syndrome is recognized. In this study, 28% of IC patients have definite or probable Sjögren's syndrome. This association is much stronger than is generally recognized. This could be due to difficulties in diagnosing Sjögren's syndrome since a diagnosis usually requires a high index of suspicion.</em></small><br>[ID: 14641413]"

Buijs J, Borsboom G, van Gemund JJ, Hazebroek A, van Dongen PA, van Knapen F, Neijens HJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Toxocara seroprevalence and the relation between Toxocara seroprevalence and allergic asthma were investigated in Dutch schoolchildren aged 4-6 years. Data on Toxocara antibodies, allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, allergic manifestations, and risk factors (pets and playgrounds) were obtained from 235 children from The Hague and 477 from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The surveys were carried out from September 1987 to January 1988 in The Hague and in March and April 1989 in Rotterdam. Logistic regression was used to evaluate putative relations. Toxocara seroprevalence was higher in The Hague (11%) than in Rotterdam (6%), but this difference was not quite significant. Seroprevalences varied widely among schools. No differences between socioeconomic categories or between the sexes were found. Occurrences of asthma/recurrent bronchitis and hospitalization due to asthma/recurrent bronchitis were significantly associated with seroprevalence. Furthermore, a marginally significant relation with eczema was found. Immunoglobulin E specific for inhaled allergens occurred significantly more often in the Toxocara-seropositive group. The risk factors investigated were not related to seroprevalence. It is suggested that Toxocara, among other environmental factors, may stimulate polyclonally immunoglobulin E production, including allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, and thus may contribute to the manifestation of allergic asthma and possibly of eczema in children predisposed to allergy.</em></small><br>[ID: 7977294]"

Nussbaum JC, Van Dyken SJ, von Moltke J, Cheng LE, Mohapatra A, Molofsky AB, Thornton EE, Krummel MF, Chawla A, Liang HE, Locksley RM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Eosinophils are specialized myeloid cells associated with allergy and helminth infections. Blood eosinophils demonstrate circadian cycling, as described over 80 years ago, and are abundant in the healthy gastrointestinal tract. Although a cytokine, interleukin (IL)-5, and chemokines such as eotaxins mediate eosinophil development and survival, and tissue recruitment, respectively, the processes underlying the basal regulation of these signals remain unknown. Here we show that serum IL-5 levels are maintained by long-lived type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) resident in peripheral tissues. ILC2 cells secrete IL-5 constitutively and are induced to co-express IL-13 during type 2 inflammation, resulting in localized eotaxin production and eosinophil accumulation. In the small intestine where eosinophils and eotaxin are constitutive, ILC2 cells co-express IL-5 and IL-13; this co-expression is enhanced after caloric intake. The circadian synchronizer vasoactive intestinal peptide also stimulates ILC2 cells through the VPAC2 receptor to release IL-5, linking eosinophil levels with metabolic cycling. Tissue ILC2 cells regulate basal eosinophilopoiesis and tissue eosinophil accumulation through constitutive and stimulated cytokine expression, and this dissociated regulation can be tuned by nutrient intake and central circadian rhythms. </em></small><br>[ID: 24037376]"
